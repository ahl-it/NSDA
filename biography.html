      <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p> Malcolm X (1925–1965) was more than a leader—he was a force of nature. Rising from hardship and injustice, he became one of the most influential voices of the civil rights movement. He spoke with unshakable conviction about self-respect, equality, and freedom, inspiring generations to challenge oppression in all its forms. This website is dedicated to honoring his life, his ideas, and the legacy that continues to shape the fight for justice today.

     <h2>Malcolm Little’s Beginnings</h2>
     <P>Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska. His parents, Earl and Louise Little, were active supporters of Marcus Garvey’s movement for Black self-determination. Racism and violence marked his early life—his father was killed under suspicious circumstances, and his family was torn apart.
        As a young man, Malcolm faced poverty, discrimination, and crime, which led to his imprisonment at the age of 20. It was in prison that Malcolm transformed himself through relentless reading and self-education, preparing for a life that would change history.</P><hr>
     <h2>Rise as a Leader</h2>
     <P>Nation of Islam Years Upon his release in 1952, Malcolm joined the Nation of Islam, adopting the name “Malcolm X” to reject the “Little” surname given to his enslaved ancestors. His powerful speeches and organizing skills attracted thousands of new members.
        Malcolm urged African Americans to embrace self-respect, economic independence, and the right to defend themselves against racial violence. He became a national figure—admired by many for his courage and criticized by others for his uncompromising stance.</P><hr>
    <h2>A Journey Beyond Boundaries</h2>

     <P>In 1964, Malcolm left the Nation of Islam after disagreements with its leadership. That same year, he made the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj), where he experienced a profound spiritual awakening. Meeting Muslims of all races and backgrounds changed his outlook—he began advocating for unity across racial lines in the fight against injustice.
        He founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), dedicated to linking the struggle of African Americans to liberation movements around the world.</P><hr>
    <h2>Legacy</h2>  
    <p>Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City, at just 39 years old. His life was brief, but his influence is eternal.
Through his speeches, writings, and example, Malcolm taught millions to take pride in their identity, to speak truth without fear, and to demand equality by any means necessary. Today, activists and thinkers continue to draw strength from his vision of freedom and justice.
